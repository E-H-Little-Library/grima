# I want to write my own grimas!

Have you used a grima that's almost perfect, that almost saved you hours of
work, except for one simple detail that might take hours to fix?

Then you probably want to make your own grima that does exactly the right
thing for you!

The easiest way to get started is to slightly modify an existing grima.
You can use [derive-grima.sh](../grimas/derive-grima.sh) <!-- link makes more
sense on github --> to copy an existing grima to a new name.

## I need to mess with some marc!

You'll want to check out the [Normalization Rules for MARC](NORMAC.md)
library which has been included with grima since the 2019-12 release.

## I need to access some stable but hard to get to data!

You'll want to store it in a secret database hidden within Alma...
the [Grima Data Store](DATASTORE.md)

## I want to talk to other grima authors
